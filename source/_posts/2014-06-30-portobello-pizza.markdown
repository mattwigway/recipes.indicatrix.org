I bought some Portobello mushrooms from the [Garfield Park Farmers' Market](http://garfieldconservatory.org/chicago-farmers-markets-at-the-conservatory.htm), and I thought it would be good to make them into pizzas, with the mushroom caps serving as a base and
the pizza fixings on top. (Full disclosure: someone may have mentioned this to me, I can't recall; I'm
[not the first one to do it](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=portobelllo+pizza&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).)

I first cut the stems off the caps, and then discarded the part of the stem covered in dirt, saving the rest for later.

Then I removed the gills with a spoon:

I coated the caps in oil and places them, stem-side-down, into a baking dish and baked
for 10 minutes at 400&deg; F. If you're using metal rather than Pyrex you'll want to raise
the temperature about 25&deg; F.

While the caps were cooking, I cleaned up my cutting board from the gills, and cut the
clean parts of the stems into small pieces to later place on the pizza as a topping.

When the caps had cooked 10 minutes, I drew them out of the oven and flipped them over so that
the stem side was up. I poured pizza sauce over them (I used sauce from a jar because I already had it,
but you can make your own) and then placed the sliced up stems in the sauce.

Then, I put cheese on each cap (I used pepper jack).

I then cooked them in the same 400&deg; F oven for another 10-12 minutes.

I would recommend adding oregano if you have any (I didn't). Three mushrooms provided
a large dinner for one, your mileage may vary.
